# BUILD_AN_SVM-_CLASSIFIER_FROM_SCRATCH
Support Vector Machine is a type of supervised learning algorithm which is extremely  useful when we are dealing with datasets having more than 2 features, i.e., 3 or more- dimensional data. This algorithm is clean and accurate even when our model is trained  on complex non-linear data. After training, the algorithm creates a hyperplane where each classification is done in such a way that each type of data is present on either side of the hyperplane.
